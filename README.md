## rateconversations

This is a experiment implemented using [jsPsych](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych)
in which participants rate participants in spoken conversations.

The conversations could contain *um*, *uh*, or *neither*.

I think jsPsych is normally used for online experiments, but this just saves
data offline.
